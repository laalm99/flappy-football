# Flappy Football by Lamya
"Flappy Football" is my interpretation of the "Flappy Bird" mini game that I made for the C# and Unity Interactive Mini Game Project provided by SAMI and VRMADA.

The player earns +1 points if they surpass an obstacle without colliding and when they interact with a "friendly" footballer (in the green).
The player loses the game once they collide with an obstacle (the footballer in the orange or a flag) or fall to the ground.
